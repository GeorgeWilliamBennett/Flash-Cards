# Introduction

I was inspired to make this app because I am in college and flash cards are a useful tool. This application allows one to create sets of flash cards, populate those sets of cards, practice with them, delete cards, and delete sets of cards.

<br>

# Skills

I used several of my skill-sets in this project including:
* Python
* Flask
* Jinja 2
* Javascript
* SQL
* HTML
* CSS
* UX/UI Design

<br>

# Setup

I have put this app up on <a href="https://www.heroku.com">heroku</a>! Just <a href="https://georgesflashcards.herokuapp.com/">click here</a> to use!

# Tutorial

To use the app first click on the button that says "Create a New Set of Cards". Here you can name a set of flash cards. After creating a set you will automatically be prompted to fill out your first card. Simply type in the question and the answer you wish to have on your card.

Now you are enabled to practice! After creating a card you will automatically be brought to the practicing page. The question will be presented and you can type your best answer in the text field. Afterward hit "Confirm Answer" and the text field will become normal text and the true answer will be revealed! From here you can go to the next card in the set, create more cards, delete the current card, or go back to the main menu. When practicing cards will be shuffled every time a new card is pulled. Lastly, in the main menu you have the options to choose a set to practice or choose a set to delete. In both cases a list of existing card sets will be displayed. The former option sends you to practice and the latter deletes the set. A warning prompt is issued before anything is deleted ensuring you are not deleting anything accidentally.
